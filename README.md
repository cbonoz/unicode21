Demo flow:
* Chris, Boston, Uniramp
* Liquity explorers exist but are not approachable for new users (ex: https://defirating.finance/en/pools/, not sure what to do with this information)
* https://info.uniswap.org/#/
* https://unigrants.notion.site/RFPs-Challenges-3be614ba4e504b5caeee7b0159e64a42

- Integrated pool creation
- Rather than recreating some of the uniswap concepts. Onboard and tie into that existing functionality.
- Suite of visualization tools possible
* End with code/repo



Sponsors:
Uniswap (get users to get comfortable with pools and swapping tokens). - mainly the graph, need to add metamask interaction.
Visor (invest your assets for visor rewards). - purely visualization with the graph
Polywrap (optional)
Skynet (deployment)
