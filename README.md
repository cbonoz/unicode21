Going after the UNI Documentation and Onboarding + Inclusion and access categories.


<!--

Demo flow:
* Lquity explorers exist but are not approachable for new users (ex: https://defirating.finance/en/pools/, not sure what to do with this information)
* https://info.uniswap.org/#/
* https://unigrants.notion.site/RFPs-Challenges-3be614ba4e504b5caeee7b0159e64a42
* As a new user, I'm not looking for pools or tokens right away - I'm thinking trading and earning.
